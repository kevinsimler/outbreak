A playable disease simulator.

Apologies that the code is not better organized and commented. I threw this together at the last minute =/.

Here's how I compile and deploy:

```
#!/bin/bash

echo "BUILDING new version"
npm run build

echo "RSYNCING to deployment server"
rsync -avze ssh build/ username@host:/path/to/deploy/dir
```

What follows is boilerplate from the Create React App initialization code:

——

This project compiles using NPM and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
